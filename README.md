# PasswordGenerator
# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

HELP NEEDED!!! This is by far the most frustrating of all exercises because I have a rough working knowledge of how to write the psuedo code below, but when it comes to translating into actual Javascript code I don't seem to know what to do, from structuring the code to properly writing it using the correct syntax, how functions are used within the code, etc. Help is needed and any is appreciated.




------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

If you are unfamiliar with special characters, take a look at [some examples](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters).

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Acceptance Criteria
textarea (display only)
generateBtn (click only)
  if I click on the generateBtn it is going to prompt me for
    1-number of chars
      I can input 8-128
      Then validate whether I have less than 8 and more than 128
    2-uppercase
      it checks to see if i want uppercase. Likely a boolean input
    3-lowercase
      it checks to see if i want lowercase. Likely a boolean input
    4-special chars
      it checks to see if I want special chars. Likely a boolean input
    5-numbers
      it checks to see if I want to use numbers

    Based on my responses to the above questions,   
var password

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
*create event listener that hooks to btn click
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
*create prompt asking for password length
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
*select at least 8 up to and including 128 and no more than 128
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
*create a prompt asking for character types
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
*create radio selection of lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
*set variable for answer(s)
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
*?
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
*store the password in a variable
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
*create temporarily write to the page what the password was that was genergated
```

The following image demonstrates the application functionality:
